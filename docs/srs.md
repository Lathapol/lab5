# Software Requirements Specification

**Product:** Workflow and Approval System (university department)
**Version:** 0.1 (draft) | **Date:** 5 November 2026 | **Theme:** 5. Workflow and Approval System

## 1. Stakeholder problem and context

A university department receives internal requests for funding, purchases, travel and reimbursement. Today these are handled informally, so nobody can easily see where a request is, who is responsible for it, or why it was approved or rejected.

The product is a web application in which staff submit requests, reviewers pick up and decide them, and every decision is recorded with its reason and history. All data in the product is synthetic.

## 2. Actors

| Actor | Responsibilities |
|---|---|
| Requester | Logs in, submits requests, views the status, decision and reason of their own requests, (later) edits and resubmits returned requests. |
| Reviewer | Logs in, views the queue of unassigned requests, claims a request, approves or rejects it (with a reason when rejecting), (later) returns requests and gives second-stage approval. |

Each account has exactly one role. There is no administrator role in this product.

## 3. Scope and exclusions

**In scope (whole product):** authentication and role-based access; request submission with category and amount; reviewer queue and claiming; approve/reject decisions with reasons; append-only history log; (later) return and resubmission, filtering and search, second approval stage, decision summaries.

**Exclusions:** self-registration, password recovery, email verification, user administration, multiple roles per account, file attachments, email or other notifications, real payment or budget systems, any external API, multi-department support.

## 4. Functional requirements

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| FR-01 | A user can log in with a username and password and receives an authenticated session. |
| FR-02 | A logged-in user can log out, after which the session no longer grants access. |
| FR-03 | The system can return the identity and role of the currently logged-in user. |
| FR-04 | A Requester can submit a request with title, category, amount and justification; it is created as Pending with no reviewer. |
| FR-05 | A Requester can list their own requests with their current status. |
| FR-06 | A Requester can open one of their own requests and see its status, assigned reviewer, decision and decision reason. |
| FR-07 | A Reviewer can list requests, including a queue view of Pending (unassigned) requests, and open any request read-only. |
| FR-08 | A Reviewer can claim a Pending request, which moves it to In Review and assigns it to them. |
| FR-09 | The assigned Reviewer can approve an In Review request. |
| FR-10 | The assigned Reviewer can reject an In Review request by giving a reason. |
| FR-11 | The system appends a history entry (actor, time, from-state, to-state, reason) for every state transition. |
| FR-12 | A Reviewer can list the requests they have claimed. |
| FR-13 | A request's detail view shows its history log to its Requester and to any Reviewer. |
| FR-14 | The assigned Reviewer can return an In Review request to its Requester with a reason. |
| FR-15 | A Requester can edit a Returned request and resubmit it. |
| FR-16 | Request lists can be filtered and searched by status, category, date range and text. |
| FR-17 | Requests at or above an amount threshold require a second approval from a different Reviewer. |
| FR-18 | A Reviewer can view a decision summary (counts by status, category and Reviewer). |

## 5. Business rules

| ID | Rule |
|---|---|
| BR-01 | A request must have a non-empty title, a category from the fixed list (Funding, Purchase, Travel, Reimbursement), an amount greater than 0 (in THB) and a non-empty justification; otherwise it is rejected and nothing is stored. |
| BR-02 | A newly submitted request has state Pending and no reviewer. |
| BR-03 | Only these transitions are valid in Sprint 1: Pending → In Review, In Review → Approved, In Review → Rejected. Any other transition is rejected and the stored state does not change. |
| BR-04 | A request has exactly one reviewer. If two Reviewers claim the same request at the same time, exactly one claim succeeds. |
| BR-05 | Only the Reviewer who claimed a request may approve or reject it. A decision by any other Reviewer is rejected with no state change. |
| BR-06 | A Reviewer cannot claim or decide a request whose Requester is that same user (self-approval is blocked even if roles were ever combined). |
| BR-07 | Rejecting a request requires a non-empty reason. A reason is optional when approving. |
| BR-08 | A submitted request cannot be edited by anyone, except that a Returned request can be edited by its Requester (see BR-13). |
| BR-09 | Approved and Rejected are final states. |
| BR-10 | History entries are append-only: they cannot be edited or deleted through the application. |
| BR-11 | A Requester can see only their own requests. A Reviewer can view all requests read-only, but can claim only Pending requests and can decide only requests they claimed (BR-05). |
| BR-12 | Every account has exactly one role. |
| BR-13 | Only a Returned request may be edited, and only by its own Requester. |
| BR-14 | The second approval of a request must come from a Reviewer different from the first Reviewer and from the Requester. |

## 6. Non-functional requirements

| ID | Requirement and measurable target | Verification | Sprint |
|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-01 | Every protected endpoint rejects an unauthenticated request with status 401 and returns no private data. | API test over all protected endpoints | 1 |
| NFR-02 | Forbidden role or ownership access is rejected (403, or 404 where existence must not leak) and returns no private data. | API tests: requester on review operations, cross-requester access, unclaimed reviewer | 1 |
| NFR-03 | Passwords are stored only as salted hashes; no plaintext password appears in the database or logs. | Integration test inspecting stored values | 1 |
| NFR-04 | All request and history data survives a backend restart. | Integration test (restart, re-read) plus manual check | 1 |
| NFR-05 | List endpoints respond in under 500 ms (95th percentile) on a local machine with 1,000 seeded requests. | Timed API test | 3 |
| NFR-06 | Under 2 simultaneous claim attempts on one request, exactly one succeeds and exactly one claim history entry exists. | Concurrent integration test | 1 |
| NFR-07 | A fresh clone can be set up and its tests run using only the README commands. | Fresh-clone dry run by the teammate | 1 |
| NFR-08 | Every form shows a field-level error for each invalid field and keeps the entered values. | UI component test and one end-to-end test | 1 |

## 7. Assumptions

| ID | Assumption |
|---|---|
| A-01 | Demo accounts are seeded: two Requesters and two Reviewers. |
| A-02 | The system serves a single department. |
| A-03 | Amounts are in Thai baht (THB) with no currency conversion. |
| A-04 | Reviewers can see all requests, including those claimed by other Reviewers, but only for reading; they cannot claim or decide them (BR-11, D-14). |
| A-05 | The categories list is fixed and is not editable by users. |
| A-06 | The second approval stage (FR-17, BR-14) applies above a threshold amount that will be fixed before Sprint 3 (see Q-02). |

## 8. Resolved decisions

| # | Decision | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| D-01 | Roles | Requester and Reviewer. One role per account. |
| D-02 | Request categories | Fixed list: Funding, Purchase, Travel, Reimbursement. |
| D-03 | Request fields | Title, category, amount, justification. |
| D-04 | Reviewer assignment | Reviewers claim requests from a queue of unassigned requests. Claiming assigns the request to that reviewer. Each request has exactly one reviewer. |
| D-05 | Self-approval | A claim or decision is rejected if the reviewer is the request's requester. No account has both roles. |
| D-06 | Editing after submission | Locked in Sprint 1. Return and resubmission are Sprint 2. |
| D-07 | History | Append-only log entry per transition: actor, time, from-state, to-state, reason. |
| D-08 | Rejection reason | Required on Reject, optional on Approve. |
| D-09 | Sprint 1 states | Pending (unassigned), In Review, Approved, Rejected. Valid: Pending→In Review, In Review→Approved, In Review→Rejected. Everything else is rejected. |
| D-10 | Seed data | Two requesters and two reviewers. |
| D-11 | Stack | Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite, React Router, Bootstrap. Backend: Node.js, Express, TypeScript. Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM. Testing: Vitest and Supertest (unit, API/database integration, UI), Playwright (end-to-end). |
| D-12 | Terminology | "Reviewer" (matches the spec), not "approver". |
| D-13 | Unclaimed or unrelated decision | A reviewer who has not claimed a request cannot approve or reject it (403, no state change). |
| D-14 | Reviewer visibility | Reviewers can view all requests read-only, including those claimed by other Reviewers. They can claim only Pending requests and decide only requests they claimed. |

## 9. Open questions

| ID | Question | Needed by | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q-01 | After a Returned request is resubmitted, does it go back to the queue or to the same Reviewer? | Sprint 2 contracts | Open |
| Q-02 | What amount threshold triggers the second approval stage? | Sprint 3 contracts | Open |
| Q-03 | Authentication mechanism (session cookie or token, expiry, hashing algorithm). | System SDS (Part C) | Open |
